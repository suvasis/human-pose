High Resolution Net (HRNet) is a state of the art neural network for human pose estimation — an image processing task which finds the configuration of a subject’s joints and body parts in an image. The novelty in the network is to maintain the high resolution representation of the input data and combine it in parallel with high to low resolution sub-networks, while keeping efficient computation complexity and parameters count.
